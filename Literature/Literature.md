## Reference Manager Software
Please use JabRef <http://www.jabref.org> for managing your bibliography and PDF copies of "the literature" (journal articles, theses, reports, etc.). JabRef is open-source, cross-platform (Java) and compatible with the BibTeX program which works with LaTeX to easily create bibliographies for documents in various styles.

## Reference Filename and BibTeX Key Convention
Please use the same convention for literature filenames and BibTeX keys convention of ```SurnameYYYYjournalabbreviationVVpPPPP.pdf``` where ```Surname``` is the first author's surname, ```YYYY``` is the publication year, ```journalabbreviation``` is a 2-4 letter abbreviation of the journal title (depending on journal title), ```p``` is the literal letter "p" and ```PPPP``` is the page number (or article number for those journals which have dispensed with page numbers). Example: Quilty2017oc389p283 for J. W. Quilty, Optics Communications **389**, 283 (2017).

## Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
DOI are indispensible and should be saved in the JabRef entry for an item _whenever available_. Academic life as a graduate student was _much_ harder before DOI were used because URLs were not always available and are susceptible to "link rot". See the FAQ on http://dx.doi.org/ for more information. If you're ever given an unlinked DOI and need to resolve it, simply prefix the DOI with ```http://dx.doi.org/```.
