  abstract    = {A switching regulator for reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI) includes a PWM controller which incorporates a varying frequency oscillator for controlling the operating frequency of the switching regulator. The varying frequency oscillator provides an oscillating signal having a continuously varying frequency about the center switching frequency of the switching regulator. The varying frequency oscillating signal causes the operating frequency of the switching regulator to vary, spreading out the EMI noise generated by the switching regulator and effectively reducing the peak energy of the EMI noise.},
