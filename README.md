# Repository Directory Structure

### Documents

Any files which aren't _Literature_, i.e. anything that won't or can't be cited.

### Literature

A flat folder containing PDF copies of anything that will or could be cited in the reports: journal articles, tech notes, etc.  There should be a BibTeX `.bib` bibliography file at the same level as the PDF files, for use with the [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org) open source bibliography and reference manager.

### Presentations

The files used in any presentations, including the final presentation.

### Reports

Contains the ENGR 489 reports. There are two reports required this year, a Preliminary Report and a Final Report.

* LaTeX source files.
* R, Matlab, etc. files, containing _only_ the figures used in the report at this level.
* One sub-folder "Figures" to keep figures organised.
