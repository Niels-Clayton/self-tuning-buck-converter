# Presentations Directory

Powerpoint is popular, but the same reasons to prefer text-based formats for reports also apply to presentations. Text-based presentation formats are [LaTeX with the Beamer class](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer) and the [HTML presentation format reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/> can also be used to generate Beamer or reveal.js presentations from structured [Markdown](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/help/user/markdown) documents, see [Producing slide shows with Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc) in the Pandoc manual for details.

This directory should contain one subdirectory per presentation.
