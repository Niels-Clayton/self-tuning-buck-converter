\chapter{Future Plan}\label{C:future} 

\section{Work to be Completed}

\begin{itemize}

    \item 
    Discuss what work I still have to do before beginning the evaluation of the system. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Select sensors to measure peak-to-peak ripple current
        \item finalise the circuit design for the project, this includes selection all other components needed for it's operation.
        \item Create a final PCB for the design 
        \item Design the controller that will control both output voltage and inductor ripple 
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{System Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}

    \item 
    Discuss how the system will be evaluated, reference the project proposal as this will not have changed significantly.  

\end{itemize}

\section{Project Timeline}

\begin{itemize}

    \item 
    Create another Gant chart that now more accurately breaks down the required tasks into the remaining time. Discuss this chart and why it is set out the way that it is. 

\end{itemize}



\section*{Feedback}\label{S:feedback} 

% This could highlight any difficulties currently faced, and make specific requests for guidance from the examination committee. For example, a student may be unsure how best to evaluate their artefact, and would appreciate suggestions for alternative methods. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item I want to ask for some suggestion on evaluating the final artefact. The evaluation described within my proposal has not changed, and it seems to be very simple at the moment.   
\end{itemize}
