\section{System Evaluation}
  
    The evaluation of the system will be conducted using a range of load resistances, evaluating its performance with 10$\Omega$, 15$\Omega$, and 20$\Omega$ output loads, using a constant supply voltage of 12V DC.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The buck converter will be able to take input voltages up to 12V DC
	
	\item The buck converter must maintain the basic functionality outlined in \cref{E:V_out}

	\item The buck converter will have an output voltage range between 3V and 10V DC
	
	\item The output voltage accuracy will be within $\pm 5\%$ of the target output voltage

	\item The user will be able to define the inductor ripple between 20\% and 50\%
	
	\item The inductor ripple accuracy will be within $\pm 5\%$ of the defined inductor ripple
	
	\item The buck converter will have a switching frequency range of 1k$Hz$ to 100k$Hz$

	\item The control system will have no steady state error

\end{itemize}
